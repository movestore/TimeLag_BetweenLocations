Github repository: https://github.com/movestore/TimeLag_BetweenLocations

## Description
Calculation of the time lag between consecutive locations.

## Documentation
This App calculates the time lag between each consecutive locations. This measurement is a segment characteristic, and will be assigned to the first location of each segment. Therefore the time lag of the last location of the track will be set to NA.

A histogram of the time lag distribution of all individuals and per individual is automatically created and can be downloaded in the output as a pdf.

A column named _**timelag**_ will be appended to the dataset that is returned for further use in next Apps. This column also contains the **unit** information in which the time lag was calculated.
